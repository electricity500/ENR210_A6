 Assignment 06      Due Thursday by 11:59pm Points 10 Submitting a file upload  All I want you to do for this assignment is to go to the internet, find an interesting data set, and then write a gnuplot script to plot it.   Then zip your data file and upload both the zipped data file and the gnuplot script to canvas.  I will unzip your file and I will run your gnuplot file to plot the data. Your points will be granted as follows:      completed assignment 2 points     plot works and appears on my screen 2 points     your plot has titles, labels and looks good 2 points     your data set is properly formatted (i.e. a text file with columns of data only) 1 point     your data set is interesting (i.e. it shows something cool and I can show the other engineering profs and they will say "cool". Just random numbers or some math function is not very interesting for example) 3 points  Thanks! There is only two more assignments in the course. The next lectures in the series will show you how to do them.
